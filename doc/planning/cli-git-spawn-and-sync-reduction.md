# cli-git: fewer processes and fewer syncs per commit, and retry on process exhaustion

Status: accepted for implementation by the user (2026-10-29), scope below.
Owner package: `package/git-policy/cli`. Tracking issue: 1804 (follow-up work found while stabilizing it).

## Why

A wrapped `git commit` of one explicit path starts about 45 real Git processes and makes about 41 sync calls,
against one process and no syncs for direct Git. Measured on an idle host with the debug and release builds alike:

- wall time about 180 ms per commit, of which about 77 ms is inside sync calls (strace, same fixture);
- the container gate takes 12 to 32 seconds for the commit tests under host load, and the same suite takes about 67
  seconds when the host is quiet;
- a host-wide fork-failure episode (the user cgroup recorded 598 limit events) failed commits with
  `Resource temporarily unavailable (os error 11)`.

Every process start and every sync is multiplied by load, so the fix is to do less of both and to ride out a short
refusal to start a process.

## Decisions (user)

- Process-exhaustion safeguard: retry failed starts everywhere, and also retry read-only and shadow-repository Git
  commands that fail inside themselves (`unable to create thread`, `cannot fork`), with an allow-list.
- Spawn reduction: save as many processes as possible, engineering the replacement in the wrapper where the result is
  provably identical to Git's, in the manner of `package/forbidden-strings/core` (own engine, an
  `OPTIMIZATIONS.md`-style log of measured wins and rejections, oracle-checked parity).
- Journal syncs: option B of the earlier question (sync at the barriers before side effects), after a crash
  harness exists that tears, drops and reorders records.

## Method

- Parity first: every in-process replacement is tested against real Git (`git` is the oracle) over generated cases,
  and falls back to spawning Git for any shape it does not handle exactly. A fallback is never a failure.
- Every replacement shows its win with the same scripts: `GIT_TRACE2_PERF` process counts and `strace` sync counts.
  A permanent budget test per measure ratchets down after each slice (a regression fails the host and gate suites).
- A guard test is shown failing before the change is kept (the repo's rule).
- What is measured and rejected is recorded here, with the number or the counterexample.

## Process-start retry (slice R)

A start that fails with `EAGAIN` (`ErrorKind::WouldBlock`) started nothing, so retrying is always safe.

- One helper starts every child: 10 ms backoff doubling to 500 ms, a 5 s total budget, one warning per retry, then the
  existing error plus the attempt count. It covers the roughly 20 call sites (`run_git`, bounded children,
  forwarding including the `execve` path, hooks, signal relay, post-commit, probes).
- Git commands that start and then fail inside themselves are retried only from an allow-list of commands that are
  harmless to re-run (read-only queries, and the idempotent shadow-repository steps), matched on the exit status and
  the wording of the failure; mutating steps (reference updates, landing) are not retried, and recovery already
  completes or rolls back those.
- Tests: a unit test with a start that refuses K times; the fork-failure sweep gains burst cases
  (`--inject=clone3:error=EAGAIN:when=N..N+K`), which must now succeed for bursts shorter than the budget.

## Candidate replacements, with the exactness condition for each

Measured process lifetimes of one commit (strace): `findmnt` 3 runs about 25 ms, `rev-parse` 12 runs about 32 ms,
`config` 7 runs about 16 ms, `git hook` 4 runs about 14 ms plus the wrapper's own hook shim re-executions.

- Hook shims for events with no hook: the shadow commit points `core.hooksPath` at shims that re-enter the wrapper,
  which takes the hook lock (a synced lock candidate) and runs `git hook run --ignore-missing <event>`. An event with
  no user hook needs no shim. Exact when conservative: the shim is omitted only if the user's hooks directory has no
  entry of that name at all (any mode, because Git prints a hint for a non-executable file) and the configuration has
  no `hook.<name>.event` or `.command` key; any other shape keeps today's behavior. Saves up to four wrapper
  re-executions, four `git hook` runs and four synced lock candidates.
- `findmnt` (3 runs): the filesystem identity of `.git` and `index.lock`. To be replaced by `statx`, `/proc/self/mountinfo`
  and `/dev/disk/by-uuid` when the mapping is unambiguous; otherwise `findmnt` stays. Needs a check of how the
  identity is consumed before choosing (recorded below when read).
- One configuration snapshot (`git config --list -z --show-scope`) in place of the separate `config` runs
  (`core.hooksPath`, the four `hook.<event>.enabled` reads already batched, the maintenance keys, ref storage).
  Last value wins, `-c` and `GIT_CONFIG_*` values come last, bool canonicalized by Git's rules; `--type=path` values
  starting with `~` or `%(prefix)` fall back to a spawn.
- Empty-tree object name: the hash of `tree 0` under the repository's object format (a constant per format) in place of
  `git hash-object -t tree --stdin`.
- `symbolic-ref HEAD` (files ref storage): read `HEAD`; anything but `ref: <name>` or a full object name falls back.
  The landing re-read stays a read of the same file, so the compare-and-swap protection is unchanged.
- Sequencer markers (`MERGE_HEAD`, `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD`, `REVERT_HEAD`) on the files backend: when none of the
  loose files (including the six lookup spellings `rev-parse` tries) exists and `packed-refs` does not contain the
  name, they are absent without a spawn; any hit falls back to `rev-parse --verify`. A dangling marker therefore
  stays a conclusion (pinned by `a_marker_naming_a_missing_object_is_still_a_conclusion`).
- `git version`: cached per binary identity (path, size, mtime, inode) in the repository's private directory.

## Rejected, with evidence

- Reading the three sequencer markers with `cat-file --batch-check`: it reports a marker that names a missing object
  as missing, so a corrupt merge would become a plain commit that drops the merge parent.
- Merging `core.hooksPath` with the maintenance reads by hand: different phases and a `--type=path` value; covered
  instead by the snapshot above.
- Capping Git's threads (`pack.threads=1`, `core.preloadindex=false`): 101 ms against 105 and 100 ms baseline, and
  the container was never throttled (`nr_throttled 0`).
- Re-reading `HEAD` and the target ref once instead of twice: the second reads at landing are the compare-and-swap
  protection.

## Journal syncs (slice J, task 69)

Order from the independent review: skip directory syncs where nothing changed (three `ensure_*` syncs), skip the two
syncs after removing a landed transaction directory, defer directory syncs to barriers, add torn-record tolerance for
pre-landing records with a tearing, dropping and reordering harness (a kill is not a power loss), and only then drop
file syncs of pre-landing records. Lock-candidate syncs stay: a torn blocking `owner.json` would stick every
acquirer. The sync-site table is in `doc/handover/cli-git-rust-implementation.md`.

## Budgets

The host and gate suites carry a spawn budget (from `GIT_TRACE2_PERF`) and the host suite a sync budget (from
`strace`); each slice lowers its budget to the measured count. Starting point: 45 processes, 41 syncs.
