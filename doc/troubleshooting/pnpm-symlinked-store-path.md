# pnpm 12.16.1: symlinked shared store breaks DSH Advisor's proper-lockfile import

## Symptom

DSH `0.2.1-rc.5` cannot activate `@monochromatic-dev/dsh-plugin-advisor`:

```text
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'proper-lockfile'
imported from .../@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/dist/core/settings-manager.js
```

The installed Pi package is `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@1.5.0`.
Directly importing its `dist/core/settings-manager.js` with Node `26.13.0`
reproduced the same diagnostic without DSH.

## Root cause

The workspace intentionally replaces `proper-lockfile` with
`package/pnpm-override/shim-proper-lockfile` through a `link:` override.
The [shim decision](../decision/proper-lockfile-removal.md) still applies.
The shim file exists; its installed dependency link is broken.

The shared store setting expands `$HOME` to `/home/user`,
while the physical directory is `/var/home/user`.
Reading the installed dependency link and resolving its relative contents
from its physical parent produced
`/var/var/home/user/Monochromatic/package/pnpm-override/shim-proper-lockfile`.
That path does not exist.

This is a store-path spelling defect,
not a missing shim implementation or a DSH loader interception defect.

## Verification

Diagnosis recorded at 2026-11-05T10:30:00-05:00.
The exact recording time is not a measurement of when the incident began.

A disposable project used `is-odd@3.0.1`,
a local `is-number` shim,
`virtualStoreType: global`,
and a store reached through a symlink to a deeper directory.
Both installs used pnpm `12.16.1` through a fixture Mise task.

- Symlinked store spelling:
  installation succeeded,
  the transitive link pointed into a nonexistent directory,
  and the consumer failed with `Cannot find module 'is-number'`.
- Canonical spelling of the same store with `install --force`:
  the transitive link resolved to the shim,
  and `require('is-odd')(3)` printed `true`.

The fixture directory was
`~/temp/agent/advisor-store-path-krq2xQ`.
The runner was `~/temp/agent/advisor-store-path-probe.ts`.
These scratch paths are evidence locations,
not durable test dependencies.

## Repair

`.config/mise/conf.d/20-env.toml` supplies `PNPM_CONFIG_STORE_DIR`
using Mise's `canonicalize` filter on the existing home directory.
The rest of the shared store path remains unchanged.
The environment override takes precedence over the workspace YAML spelling.
Canonicalizing home allows a fresh installation where the store does not yet exist.

This retains the approved shared virtual store and the existing lockfile shim.
It requires the repository's Mise environment;
a caller outside that environment must supply a canonical `--store-dir` itself.
Additional symlinks inside `.local/share/pnpm/store` are not covered by canonicalizing home alone.

Installed-tree repair and DSH activation verification are pending.

## What does not work

Adding another shim dependency to Advisor would leave Pi's broken dependency link in place.
Removing the shim would violate the runtime contract recorded in the shim decision.
Changing DSH's loader cannot repair a failure reproduced by direct Node import.
Hand-editing the store symlink would leave the next install able to recreate it incorrectly.

## Upstream filing decision

No upstream message has been sent.
Source references and the filing assessment will be recorded with final verification.
