# Translation repair handover snapshots: what the run costs in credits and the spend telemetry built for it, 2026-08-25

The credit estimate and its fourfold correction,
the finding that no run ever recorded its token spend (210),
the two defects only the consumer could find,
and the dated price table with its per-seat report,
controls and mutations.

Part of [Translation repair handover snapshots: 2026-08-25 to 2026-08-27](translation-repair-handover-2026-08-25-to-27.md),
which lists every file of this record.

## What the run costs in credits, and the correction that came with measuring it

The first estimate,
computed from assumed tokens per call,
was 500 to 1,500 credits for a 40-slice run.
THAT WAS HIGH BY ROUGHLY A FACTOR OF FOUR.

Measured from the run's own `reportStreamProgress` lines,
which carry content and reasoning characters per call:

```text
model                     calls   content   thinking  out-tokens  credits
qwen3.8-max                   9         0    125,612      31,403     3.77
minimax-m3                   10     6,409     98,961      26,343     0.69
deepseek-v4-pro-0813         10     4,512          0       1,128     0.10
deepseek-v4-flash-0731       10     4,214      4,066       2,070     0.05
gemma-4-26b-a4b-it           10     3,986          0         997     0.01
```

Scaled to 40 slices the output side is about 120 credits,
and adding an input side priced two to three times lower puts the whole run near 250.
So 10,000 credits buys on the order of 35 runs of this size,
not 6 to 20.

THINKING DOMINATES THE BILL.
`qwen3.8-max` and `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2` each emitted over 118,000 characters of reasoning
against a few thousand of answer,
and `completion_tokens` counts thinking.
Any cost model built on answer length underreads by most of the bill.

## Nothing we have ever run recorded its token spend (`#210`)

The estimate above had to be computed rather than read,
because token counts are not in any log this project holds.

`formatUsageNote` in `model-content.ts` reads `prompt_tokens` and `completion_tokens`
off the provider's own usage block
and appends them to an `rl.debug` line in both clients.
Every archived run logged at info,
so a grep for `[0-9]+\+[0-9]+ tokens` across every log in `~/temp/agent` returns ZERO matches.

It did not matter while Synthetic was the only provider:
a flat subscription either fits the weekly allowance or it does not,
and the `METERS` line already carries that percentage.
Charm Hyper is metered per token at rates differing by two orders of magnitude across one roster,
so cost depends on which seats answered and by how much.

`spend-line.ts` and `corpus-run/spend-read.ts` close it.
One `SPEND provider=<name> model=<id> prompt=<n> completion=<n>` line per exchange at info,
shaped like the `METERS` line so a reader splits rather than matches,
and a reader that totals a log per provider-and-model seat.

A provider that reports no usage still gets a line carrying `unreported` in both counts.
A run whose provider stayed quiet and a run that spent nothing total the same,
and only the named absence tells them apart.

## Two defects that only writing the consumer could find

Both were in code already reported as verified,
and neither was reachable from the writer's own tests.

THE MARKER CARRIED A LEADING SPACE,
copied from `METERS_MARKER`.
That one only ever meets lines carrying a logger prefix,
so it can demand the space.
This one also meets the bare line the writer RETURNS,
so `readSpendLine(reportSpend(...))` read as prose and answered `not-a-record`.
The marker is now `'SPEND '`
and the reader accepts it at start-of-line or after a space.

THE FIELD TABLE WAS A PLAIN OBJECT,
so a log line writing `__proto__=` would have reached the prototype.
Keys come off a log line;
it is a `Map` now.

This is the same lesson as the `#209` method note from one day earlier,
arriving from the other direction:
there,
mutating a module found arms nothing defended;
here,
writing the consumer found what the producer's tests could not reach.

## A run's cost is now attributable per seat, and the run in flight will never be (2026-08-25)

`#210` grew its second half while the calibration held the main worktree.
The writer and reader were already built;
what was missing was the thing that turns token counts into money.

### The price table is an observation with a date on it

`package/module/translation-repair/src/corpus-run/hyper-price.ts` (moved on 2026-10-18 to
`package/translation-repair/run/src/corpus-run/hyper-price.ts`) carries all
twenty-six models Charm Hyper lists,
with input,
output,
cache-create and cache-hit rates in credits per million tokens.
The operator read them off the provider's model page on 2026-08-25,
and `HYPER_PRICE_READ_ON` ships beside the rates so every report prints how old its figures are.

The numbers were not transcribed by hand.
A parser read the pasted page with strict structural checks,
refusing any row whose label order or rate format did not match,
and emitted the table.
Transcribing a hundred and four figures by eye is exactly where a silent error would live.

### The two cache columns are unreachable, which makes the input half exact

Nothing in `package/module/translation-repair/src` (moved on 2026-10-18 to `package/translation-repair/*/src`) sends
`cache_control`,
which is one grep to confirm.
On the Anthropic protocol Hyper speaks,
that means there are no cache-creation and no cache-read tokens,
and every prompt token bills at the plain input rate.
So the input half is exact rather than an upper bound.
The rates are carried anyway,
so whoever turns caching on finds them recorded and can see what the saving is worth.

### Synthetic is never priced, and that is a correctness rule

`priceTally` splits seats into three buckets:
metered and priced,
metered with no row in the table,
and flat-subscription.
Only the first gets a credit figure.
Folding the second into the total at zero would report a cheaper run rather than an incomplete one,
and converting the third would invent a currency that provider does not bill in.
The report names all three separately.

### What the report says, and the two controls it was checked with

```sh
mise run //package/module/translation-repair:spend-report -- <log> [<log> ...]
```

Moved on 2026-10-18 from `//package/module/translation-repair:spend-report`
to `//package/translation-repair/run:spend-report`.

Positive control,
on a throwaway fixture carrying every case at once:
priced seats sorted by cost with their share of the bill,
one unpriced metered seat named rather than zeroed,
one subscription seat carried with tokens and no credits,
one call that reported no usage counted as a floor,
one prose line mentioning the marker correctly not counted,
and one truncated record counted as unreadable.
The arithmetic checks by hand:
`qwen3.8-max` at 84000 prompt and 51065 completion tokens comes to 3.36 plus 6.13,
or 9.49 credits.

Negative control,
on the live calibration log:
`NOTHING RECORDED`,
which is the honest answer and not a zero total.

### The run in flight will never have a cost breakdown

The calibration started before `spend-line.ts` existed,
and the running build is the one it started with.
Its log carries no `SPEND` line and never will.
Rebuilding `dist/` mid-run would invalidate every cached slice and re-buy the whole run,
so this is not a thing to fix.
It is the last run this project will make that cannot say what it cost.

What the meter does give is the total.
The balance opened at exactly 10000 and read 9909 after nine slices:
about ten credits per slice,
so a forty-slice run lands near four hundred credits and a ten-thousand balance buys roughly
twenty-five of them.
That corrects the earlier per-slice figure of 8.33,
which came from a smaller sample.
The total is all the meter can say.
Which seat spent it is what the `SPEND` lines add.

### Proven by removal

Three mutations,
each caught by the file that owns the guard and by no other:

- Dropping the `glm-5.2` row from the price table:
   caught by the catalog-join case,
  which asserts every model `hyper-catalog.ts` can seat has a row.
- Making `priceTally` inherit the tally's token order instead of sorting by cost:
   caught by an ordering case built so the two disagree,
  where the seat with ten times the tokens is a quarter of the bill.
- Looking rates up on the object literal instead of the `Map`:
   caught by the `__proto__` case.

Full suite after:
659 suites,
zero failures,
zero lint warnings.

### Still parked, not landed

Everything lives in `~/temp/agent/spend-telemetry-210.tar.gz`,
fourteen files with repo-relative paths,
untarred over the repo root to apply.
It cannot be committed from the isolated worktree,
which lacks the forbidden-strings scanner and is refused by the `branch-worktree-only` policy.
It must land after the calibration finishes,
and after any second calibration batch,
because pooling needs no drift opt-in only while the build is unchanged.
