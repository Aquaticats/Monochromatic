//! What:
//!  Fill the Cargo build directories a new worktree's record asks for,
//! inside the commit service,
//! after the add that queued it has returned.
//! Why:
//!  The clone of a source checkout's build directory is the heaviest step the package repair
//!  does,
//! and it only ever fills a directory the new worktree does not have yet,
//! so nothing about the worktree's correctness depends on it finishing inside the add
//! (`package_repair_prewarm.rs`).
//! The filling is three steps per workspace:
//! clone the source's build directory into a staging directory beside the destination,
//! clean the worktree's own crates out of the staging copy,
//! and publish the staging copy under the destination's name by a rename that never replaces.
//! Both directories the clean reads and writes are named here,
//! so the filling deletes nothing from the worktree itself:
//! its only effect there is the one rename that publishes a directory the worktree did not have.
//! A destination that exists means a build got there first,
//! so the staging copy is dropped and the build keeps everything it made.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! await prewarmAwaiting(item); // for each entry: clone to the staging name, clean it, publish it unless the destination exists
//! ```
