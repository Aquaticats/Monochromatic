//! What:
//!  Merges:
//!  the word-level second pass,
//!  isolated merges and pull handling.
//! Why:
//!  Merge code shares fixtures and a journal,
//!  so it is kept together.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // merge/index.ts: one `export * from './file'` per module below.
//! ```
